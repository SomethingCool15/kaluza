Technical Test
Thanks for your application to the QA Engineer role with Kaluza. Please follow the
instructions below to create a test plan for an API.
The Task
Create BDD scenarios and step definitions to test agify.io. This is a simple API, that
accepts one parameter, a name (for example, ‘billybob’), and returns the
guesstimated age of a person with this name (for example, ‘59’).
The syntax is: https://api.agify.io/?name=billybob
Include any tests you can think of to ensure that the API functions as expected.
Further Instructions
1. This is an API test, not a UI/browser test.
2. Write in Typescript (preferred) or Javascript
3. Use Cucumber.
4. You are not expected to test the accuracy of the data presented, only the
functionality of the service.
5. You can submit the results using a public git repository (preferred) - share the
URL with the Talent Acquisition team. You can make the repository private
once we review the submission!
6. Demonstrate the test execution.
7. Whereas we prefer working software to documentation, a readme file can be
used to provide more information, including the node and npm versions.
